CS 255 – System Analysis and Design Portfolio Artifact
Project Summary

The DriverPass project involved designing a web-based driver training management system for a client named DriverPass. The company wanted to provide students with online practice exams, instructional content, and on-the-road driving lesson scheduling to help them pass their DMV driving tests. My role was to analyze the client’s needs, document system requirements, and design a system that supported multiple user roles, online scheduling, progress tracking, and secure payment handling.

What I Did Well

I believe I did particularly well in translating the interview transcript into structured, clear requirements. I carefully identified functional and nonfunctional requirements and ensured that each system component directly aligned with the client’s stated needs. I also focused on keeping the documentation organized and easy to follow.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would further refine the nonfunctional requirements by adding more measurable performance metrics, such as response time targets or availability percentages. This would strengthen the technical precision of the design documentation.

Interpreting User Needs

To interpret the user’s needs, I analyzed the interview transcript and identified key themes such as accessibility, scheduling flexibility, role-based security, and system tracking. I then translated those needs into clear system functions and constraints. Considering user needs is critical in system design because the success of a system depends on how well it solves real-world problems for its users. If user requirements are misunderstood, the system may function correctly but still fail to meet business goals.

My Approach to Designing Software

When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and identifying stakeholders. I break the system into smaller processes, define inputs and outputs, and organize requirements into functional and nonfunctional categories. In the future, I plan to continue using structured modeling techniques such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and iterative refinement to ensure systems are complete, consistent, and aligned with business objectives.
